# Python Lists 

Similar to an array but instead of single kind of a data type, it can hold different types of data. 


What is the time complexity of the len function of a list in python? 
O(1)

Why is the time complexity of the list in python O(1)?
Because it is an attribute of the iterable data type. So everytime you call the list.prototype_len() it returns an 
already stored value instead of traversing through it.
