# Binary Search

In this algorithm, you need to find an element, but the array 
is sorted. To search usually we go through all the elements 
of the array. As the array is already sorted we don't need to 
go through all the elements to get the search results. Instead, 
we can split the array by comparing the elements with the middle 
index. If the element at the middle index is greater we go to 
the next set of array elements and so on.
