# Introduction to Sorting

Let's move onto Sorting algorithms. In a search algorithm you look for an element. In a sort algorithm you're changing 
the order of elements in the array. Let's say you want to sort dolls on the basis of their heights, so you have a 
couple of decisions to make like should the tallest be at the 0th element or at the end, which algorithm needs to be 
used for sorting. you could compare the every element with the other element this is called the naive approach(brute 
force method). The naive approach is the first thing your brain stumbles on, but there are smart ways to do it. Usually 
the problems asked in interviews aren't the ones that cannot be solved with an algorithm. Also, you need to consider 
the runtime of the algorithms which includes both time and space complexity. One other major contributing factor to 
be looked for is if the algorithm is inplace or not. Inplace algorithm rearranges the array, and out of place algorithm 
does copy the whole data structure to a different one which can then be used for sorting. These algorithms have low space 
complexity, but there is a trade off that needs to be considered whether faster run time or less space consumption. It 
never hurts to say why you're picking one way or the other, but you need to suggest why did you choose that particular 
way of solving the problem.
