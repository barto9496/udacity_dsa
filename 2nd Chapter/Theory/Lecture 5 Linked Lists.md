# Linked lists

Now the array makes more sense. Think of it like a set of consecutive empty boxes which represent an address. A linked 
list on the other hand is similar to a bike chain which has links to connect two fragments / segments. A linked list is 
an extension of a list but not of an array. There still some order but there are no indices. A linked list is characterised
by its links, each element has some notion about what its next element is, since it is connected through a link. An 
array is different, like nothing in an array says that here is your next element. Whereas linked lists have some info 
about where the next element resides. The addition and removal of elements from array is harder, while it is much simpler 
in a linked list.
