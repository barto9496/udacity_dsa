# Stacks in details

Stacks can be very useful when you only care about the most recent 
elements or the order in which save the elements in really 
matters. 

## Specific terminology related to Stack

When you store an element in the stack the operation is 
called push, when you take an element out of the stack 
it is called pop instead of remove. Remember all you need 
to do here is know the top element of the stack. So, the 
operations time should be constant for both operations. 
Since stack is pretty abstract it could actually be 
implemented with another data structure
