# Welcome to Collections

Since a collections is a group of things. Collections don't have a specific order, you can shuffle them around, it 
wouldn't make a difference. Collections don't need to have same types of objects. A collection on its own cannot be used, 
but there are different data structures which are the extensions of collection and around which the collections can be 
used.
