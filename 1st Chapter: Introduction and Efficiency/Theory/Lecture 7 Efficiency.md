# Efficiency

This is one of the most important concepts of DSA, Efficiency also known as Complexity; which means how well the code is using the computers resources to get the particular job done. You can normally think about it in terms of space and time

Time Complexity(Time efficiency) How long does your code take to perform the task at hand. Space complexity how less or how optimally the code is using the space intended for your code.

The common data structures and efficiency of doing things using those data structures
